# Das Wohnzimmer by Les Lumières
Project 1 from TDM-VIRT-FSF-PT-03-2024-U-LOLC-MTTH Coding Bootcamp, developed by Yordano Pérez, Gabriela Siu and Dalia Gómez.

## Description
Das Wohnzimmer has been created to provide film enthusiasts with a platform to explore a selection of films to watch, offering the user the most relevant information about the film (e.g. synopsis, movie trailer and rating). The user also has the opportunity to input a review of his/her own, which will be appended to the information page of the movie for which the review has been made.

## Usage
This website offers users with a menu of movie genres, from which users can choose the one that they prefer. Once that an option has been selected, the user will be taken to a second page (Movie_Cards) where he/she will see a Wohnzimmer selection of movies from that genre. After this, the user will be able to click over a movie poster of the movie he/she is interested in, which will result in a famous "Wow" audio from Owen Wilson to be played, and will take the user to a third page (Movie_Trailer_Info), in which the information from that movie will be shown. This information includes: movie title, movie trailer, synopsis, rating and a button that will take the user to a modal, in which he/she will be able to input his/her own review for that particular movie. Once that the user has submitted his/her review, this review will be displayed in the "Movie_Trailer_Info" page of that particular movie. All posts that have been made for that movie will be displayed in the "Movie_Trailer_Info page" of that movie.
